                        <p class="about-singer-text">We are a <strong>jazz band</strong>, this means we can play almost <strong>any music style</strong> you like!! from Pop music to dancing hits, all adapted to our <strong>New Orleans music style</strong>. We play and we sing, all acoustically and <strong>roaming</strong> around the area.</p>
                        <p class="about-singer-text">We take our image very seriously and we love to shine, our favorite dress code is from the <strong>Gatsby</strong> era and we are also inspired by the <strong>New Orleans Marching Bands</strong>, but of course, if you have a different idea, let us know!!</p>
