                            <blockquote>What an amazing way to kick off our wedding reception, we hired the Roaming Jazz Band for our wedding in Barcelona, at first we loved their style and musical ideas, but when they started playing, roaming around and engaging with our friends and family it all became special, they truly know how to entertain and they have fun while doing it. I totally recommend them!</blockquote>

                            <blockquote>We wanted an acoustic live band for our wedding and we found the Roaming Jazz Band on Instagram, they are from Barcelona but they didn't have any problem to travel to our wedding in Mallorca, that was great from them. At the wedding they played during cocktail and and before the party, during dinner. They didn't require any extra sound equipment as they played and sing acoustically the whole time. All our guests and family loved it, I can't wait to see the pictures as it was so much fun.</blockquote>
