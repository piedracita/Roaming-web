                            <p><strong>Roaming Band at the cocktail reception</strong>, playing modern music with jazzy roots, also those standards from <strong>New Orleans</strong> that will make you dance and have fun. We <strong>roam around</strong> and engage with people, that's what we love.</p>

                            <p>The ideal is to be a <strong>3-piece band</strong> minimum but we suggest a <strong>4-piece</strong> band, this will provide <strong>full energy</strong> and a good groove to create the <strong>best music</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Get in touch with us and will confirm our <b>availability</b> and provide a <strong>quote</strong>.</p>

                            <p>We can play <strong>background music during dinner</strong> and/or special sets at the end, many ask us to appear by <strong>surprise</strong>, it's fun and from there we can walk everyone to the party area.</p>

                            <p>Many couples ask us to be there for the whole wedding, playing a couple of <strong>music sets during cocktails</strong> and a last one at the end of dinner, so we can walk everyone to the <strong>DJ/Party</strong> area as well.</p>

                            <p>Do you have a different idea? We are all ears, please let us know!</p>
